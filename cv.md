## Something about me:
I am guy 19 years old & currently working as a technical manager after graduating from an energy college. But almost immediately I realized that I didn’t want to do this, and in my free time at work I took a javarush course. But soon laziness and games took away the desire to practice. But the fire has reappeared in me and I am ready to study and practice writing code with renewed vigor, whether it is simple markup or complex algorithms.


My goal for the near future is to become a junior frontend developer and constantly develop myself by constantly trying different development paths. (development of visual novels, indie games, work with neural networks and etc.) I find all developers to be creators because with code you can create anything your mind can imagine. And this is my main reason to change profession.

## Code example:
### Task from Coursera - Snail.
A snail crawls along a vertical pole H meters high, ascending A meters during the day and descending B meters during the night. On what day will the snail crawl to the top of the pole? (The program receives integers H, A, B as input. It is guaranteed that H > A > B ≥ 0.)
```
h = int (input())
a = int (input())
b = int (input())
print ((h - a - 1) // (a - b) + 2)
```
